# Infrastructure Notes

Last updated: 2026-07-28

## Servers

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| IONOS VPS (Germany) | **Active** | Compute only — the IONOS domain/hosting products were cancelled, the VPS itself is intact. Planned/used as WireGuard exit node (`tools/wg-ionos-setup.sh`). |
| GoDaddy hosting | Cancelled | |
| IONOS (1&1) domain + hosting | Cancelled | Domains moved out; see below. |

## Domains

All domains are consolidated at **Porkbun** and **Cloudflare**, with one
permanent exception: cbus.ch stays at Dynadot.

Canonical domain for SEO purposes: **christianbusch.de**. All other owned
domains (christianbusch.org, christianbusch.info, christianbusch.us,
christianbusch.net, cbus.ch) 301-redirect to it — see
`docs/DOMAIN-REDIRECTS.md` for the redirect configuration.

| Domain | Registrar / DNS | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| mvp.sv | DNS on Cloudflare | Formerly at IONOS (1&1); points to Cloudflare as of July 2026. |
| cbus.ch | Dynadot | Staying at Dynadot permanently (deliberate exception to the consolidation). |
| (all others) | Porkbun / Cloudflare | Consolidated after the IONOS and GoDaddy cancellations. |
